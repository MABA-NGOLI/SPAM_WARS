            sometimes at the worst possible moment.
             With this card, you exchange one of the cards in your mailbox with a card from an opponent's mailbox. Neither player can see the exchanged cards.

            This card lets you shuffle an opponent's mailbox. Gather their three cards and shuffle them without looking at them, then place them back in front of them. This leaves them completely unsure of what they received.

             When you play this card, your next action will involve two players instead of one. You first play the special card, then perform your next action: send an email to two opponents, whether it's a Spam, a Clean, or a Phishing. The special card's effect allows you to attack two players simultaneously.
