          <p>The message goes back the other way… 
            sometimes at the worst possible moment.
             With this card, you exchange one of the cards in your mailbox with a card from an opponent's mailbox. Neither player can see the exchanged cards.

            This card lets you shuffle an opponent's mailbox. Gather their three cards and shuffle them without looking at them, then place them back in front of them. This leaves them completely unsure of what they received.

          <p>
             When you play this card, your next action will involve two players instead of one. You first play the special card, then perform your next action: send an email to two opponents, whether it's a Spam, a Clean, or a Phishing. The special card's effect allows you to attack two players simultaneously.

        <h3>
          On your turn, you choose one of the following actions:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>Send an Email to an Opponent (Legitimate, Spam, or Phishing)</h4>
            <p>You choose a card from your hand and give it face down to a player.</p>
            <p>The targeted player must then:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accept the email → place it in their inbox, replacing one of their 3 current cards (without looking at the received email).</li>
              <li>OR defend themselves by immediately playing a Special card 
                  You can pretend to send a legitimate email when it's actually spam... or vice versa.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Play a Special Card</h4>
            <p>
              You play a special card from your hand and apply its effect.
              Some cards change the structure of the turn ( Routing Loop), others target mailboxes ("Corrupted Mailbox").

          <li>
            <h4>Play nothing and draw a card</h4>
            <p>If you prefer not to act or you have a bad hand, you can discard a card and draw another.
